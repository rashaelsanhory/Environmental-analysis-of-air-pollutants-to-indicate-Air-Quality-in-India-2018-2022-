#### 7. Summary
#### Key Insights from the Data Analysis:
#### 1.	Widespread Unhealthy Air Quality
The data reveals that "Unhealthy" is the dominant air quality classification across the analyzed locations. This means that air pollution levels pose health risks not only to sensitive groups but to the general population as well. This underscores an urgent need for relevant authorities to implement effective air pollution control policies to safeguard public health.
#### 2.	Noticeable Deterioration in Air Quality (2020‚Äì2022)
A significant decline in air quality was observed between 2020 and 2022, primarily driven by a sharp increase in fine particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). These pollutants are particularly hazardous as they penetrate deep into the respiratory system, leading to chronic health issues. This highlights the importance of reassessing the primary sources of these pollutants and taking necessary measures to mitigate their impact.
#### 3.	High-Risk Cities Identified
The data highlights a list of high-risk cities that have consistently exhibited dangerous pollution levels over the past five years. These areas require immediate intervention. The Reported Page offers insights into key contributing factors in these cities‚Äîinformation that can support policymakers in developing targeted, data-driven strategies to improve overall air quality.



## Data Processing and Calculations
<b>This Power BI dashboard leverages several key tools and technologies to perform data transformations and calculations:</b>

#### Power Query 
Used for data importation and transformation, Power Query enables the cleaning, shaping, and loading of data sources into the Power BI environment. This process ensures that the data is in the correct format for analysis.

#### DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
DAX is utilized for creating custom calculations and measures within the dashboard. It allows for advanced data modeling and enables the creation of dynamic calculations that respond to user interactions and filter selections.

#### Data Modeling
The relationships between different data tables are established to create a comprehensive data model. This ensures accurate insights and visualizations throughout the dashboard.

These tools collectively enhance the analytical capabilities of the dashboard, providing valuable insights and performance metrics into Environmental-Analysis-of-Air-Pollutants.

This data model integrates multiple yearly datasets (2018‚Äì2022) capturing city-level air quality information, all of which are related through a common key: <b>City/Town/Village</b>. The structure indicates a star <b>schema style</b>, where each yearly data table connects to a central, consolidated <b>Air Pollutants</b> fact table that stores pollutant values along with their respective <b>year</b> and <b>location</b>.

#### Additional supporting tables include:
‚Ä¢	<b>Calendar table</b>, linked via the Date field, which facilitates time-based analysis and filtering.

‚Ä¢	<b>No. cities</b>, used to track the count or metadata about cities monitored each year.

‚Ä¢	<b>Air pollutants slicer</b> is a </b>helper table</b> created specifically for slicers to enable <b>more flexible user-driven filtering</b> without interfering with primary relationships.
